# Pizza-Restaurant-Sql-analysis-

This project involves analyzing data from a pizza restaurant using SQL to uncover insights and make data-driven recommendations. The analysis covers sales performance, customer behavior, order patterns, employee performance, and promotion effectiveness. By tracking sales trends and identifying top-selling pizzas, the restaurant can optimize its menu to focus on high-revenue items. Analyzing customer demographics and preferences helps in developing targeted promotions to drive repeat business. Understanding peak ordering times and popular order combinations allows for operational efficiency by optimizing staffing during busy periods.
